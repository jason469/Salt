# Salt
> Created by Jason Liu <br>
> This app is currently in **Release 1.0** and has been deployed

### What is Salt?
This is an application designed to be used as an online cookbook. <br>
Users can free view recipes that have been created. <br>

In order to add new recipes, the Content Management Software **Contentful** is used. <br>
This means that while anyone can view **_Salt_**, only authorised users can add recipes. 


### What technologies does this app use?
This is a simple frontend application, with all data management beind handled by a CMS. <br>
Nonetheless, the technologies used are:
- _**Gatsby**_ makes up the frontend. <br>
- _**GraphQL**_ is used to communicate between the frontend and CMS <br>
- _**SCSS**_ is used to style the application <br>
- _**Contentful**_ is used as the CMS
- _**Netlify**_ was used to deploy the application to the internet

### Future plans for the app
In the future, I also have the following ideas
- Continue styling and theming the application
